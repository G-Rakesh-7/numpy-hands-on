# numpy-hands-on

This repository contains my **hands-on practice with NumPy**, the fundamental Python library for numerical and scientific computing.  
It includes beginner-friendly **examples, exercises, and solutions** for key NumPy concepts.  


## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered  

1. Creating arrays with different data types (int, float)  
2. Working with array dimensions (1D, 2D, 3D)  
3. Identity & diagonal matrices (`np.identity`, `np.eye`)  
4. Arrays filled with zeros, ones, or custom values  
5. Random arrays with different shapes and ranges  
6. Reshaping arrays (`reshape`, transpose)  
7. Indexing & slicing (positive and negative indexing)  
8. Practical exercises (first 10 elements, last 10 elements, slicing, etc.)
